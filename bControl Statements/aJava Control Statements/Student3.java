/* 3) if-else-if ladder:
The if-else-if statement contains the if-statement followed by multiple else-if statements. In other words, we can say that it is the chain of if-else statements that create a decision tree where the program may enter in the block of code where the condition is true. We can also define an else statement at the end of the chain.

Syntax of if-else-if statement is given below.

if(condition 1) {    
statement 1; //executes when condition 1 is true   
}  
else if(condition 2) {  
statement 2; //executes when condition 2 is true   
}  
else {  
statement 2; //executes when all the conditions are false   
}  
Consider the following example.

Student.java
 */
public class Student3 {
	public static void main(String[] args) {  
		String city = "Delhi";  
		if(city == "Meerut") {  
		System.out.println("city is meerut");  
		}
		else if (city == "Noida") {  
		System.out.println("city is noida");  
		}
		else if(city == "Agra") {  
		System.out.println("city is agra");  
		}
		else {  
		System.out.println(city);  
		}  
	}
