 /* 
2) Java Multi Line Comment
The multi-line comment is used to comment multiple lines of code. It can be used to explain a complex code snippet or to comment multiple lines of code at a time (as it will be difficult to use single-line comments there).

Multi-line comments are placed between and. Any text between and is not executed by Java.

Syntax:
 */
 
 
/*  
This   
is   
multi line   
comment  
*/  

/*   
Let's use multi-line comment in a Java program.

  */

public class CommentExample2 {    
public static void main(String[] args) {    
/* Let's declare and  
 print variable in java. */    
  int i=10;    
    System.out.println(i);    
/* float j = 5.9; 
    float k = 4.4; 
    System.out.println( j + k ); */    
}
